Spree Better Terms And Conditions
=============================

This gem adds a new "Terms and Conditions" step to your Order Checkout Flow. The user is required to mark an checkbox to validate that he/she read and accepted your Terms and Conditions.

In Germany you're legally required to let the user mark a checkbox for your Terms and Conditions (Allgemeine Geschäftsbedingungen / Datenschutzerklärung). Only if the user checked an previously unchecked checkbox, the acceptance of your Terms and Conditions is valid.

If you're searching for a simpler solution without the checkbox step, you should take a look at this extension: [frankmt/spree_terms_and_conditions](https://github.com/frankmt/spree_terms_and_conditions)
